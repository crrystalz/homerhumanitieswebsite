            <p><strong>Homer</strong> <a>is a nonprofit organization created to expose more students to the humanities. The first step? Engagement. Through our monthly, short-form competition, we aim to draw more students to the humanities. Thus, to accommodate for varying skillsets, our competitions allow submissions to be in a multitude of different mediums, not just writing! See our guidelines for more information. </a></p>
            
            <p>A humanistic education is key to understanding the nuanced aspects of the arts. Don’t just trust our word. Try it out for yourself! Our competitions are designed to be low-commitment and low-risk. In the process, you might just get published if you win!</p>
